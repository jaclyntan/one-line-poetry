one line poetry is a side project by [Jakki](http://jaclyntan.com) - a graphic designer, front end developer, ideas consultant, nightfiend etc. from Perth, Australia.

The main goal of this project is to experiment with ideas, provoke thought and emotion, and mostly just to have fun, one page and one line at a time. 

I've always wanted to create a space to use both code and art **together at the same time** like paint on canvas, and although this is one of those projects that has been on the backburner of my mind for what has been years, I feel like the concept of this whole project actually makes a lot of sense considering the medium and the format. 

I've been wondering to myself _what comes next_, having created art and websites for a while now. I mean I love drawing, and I love coding, but I want to see how far I can use both code and art to take it to the next level so to speak. It's been a goal of mine to find a way to combine both design and development in interesting ways and I hope this format can achieve that.

I'm not placing any limits, schedules, standards, or other on this project - only that I hope it evokes feelings from myself and also you, the viewer.

Check back occasionally, I'm hoping to add a new one every week or so~
