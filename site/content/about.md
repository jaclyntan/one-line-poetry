## About the person

This project is created by [Jaclyn Tan](http://jaclyntan.com), a designer and front end dev from Perth Australia. It's been a dream of mine to combine both code and art in a freeform format, and as a primarily visual artist and designer, I'm not placing any limits, schedules, standards, or other on this project - only that I hope it evokes feelings from myself and also you, the viewer.

When I'm not pulling all-nighters coding or drawing, I also enjoy cooking, playing RPGs/sims(Cities Skylines, Starbound, Skyrim, Sims3 rn), reading high fantasy and trashy thriller noirs, and crafting tangible, papery things. 

## About the project

one line poetry is an ongoing conceptual design-think-piece created for the purpose of combining design, art and code in interesting and experimental ways. 

I've always wanted to create a space to utilise both code and art like paint on canvas, and creating visual art using a combination of technical and artistic mediums seemed fitting to me.

I've been tinkering with code since I was a teenager, and the thing that most inspired me to code in the first place was WordPress. More specifically their phrase "code is poetry". I have always been a very creative person - drawing, writing, etc. however I owe WP a great deal for making me realise just how immensely creative, poetic, and clever code can be too. I hope this project can be a place where code and art mutually coexist in harmony- where I can experiment and learn how to do things better too.



Check back occasionally, I'm hoping to add a new one every week or so~
